This repository demonstrates a common AsyncStorage bug in React Native and its solution.  The bug is caused by asynchronous data access where retrieving data with `getItem` occurs before `setItem` completes, resulting in inconsistent or null values. The solution uses Promises or async/await to ensure proper sequencing of asynchronous operations, resolving the inconsistent data access and preventing intermittent rendering errors.
